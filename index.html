      Hi! I am a fourth year PhD student at KU Leuven, advised by Daan Huybrechs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I do research in numerical analysis at the intersection of <b> numerical linear algebra</b> and <b>approximation theory</b>. In particular, during my PhD I have worked on sampling theory, efficient solvers and applications associated with <b> non-orthogonal expansions</b>. To this end, I use tools from computational harmonic analysis, applied functional analysis and random matrix theory. My favorite basis functions are <b>rational</b>!
